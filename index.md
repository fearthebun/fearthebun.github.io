I'm Nayaab, commonly found online as `fearthebun`. Currently, I'm in my first year at the University of Toronto's Engineering Science program, interested in specializing in Aerospace Engineering. I enjoy drawing, graphic design, and, as of late, learning new programming languages! I've been doing [Harvard's CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) to learn the basics of C.

If you want to know more about me and some of my work, click around! You're bound to find something cool :) 

If you want to contact me, feel free to do so through email ([nayaab.ali@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:nayaab.ali@mail.utoronto.ca)). I'll be sure to get back to you!
